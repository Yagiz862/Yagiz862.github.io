## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

*Lab 1:
  This lab was one of my favorite labs because it was the beginning for me in my major and it felt like a huge step in my life. I was also able to meet people who were in my     major and found the people that I was going to spend my next four years with.

*Lab 3:
  This was one of my bad labs but I was able to meet someone that helped me and let me understand the work that we were doing together. During this lab we learned how to         declare variables and other small things that were important. Our communication skills were also great.

*Lab 6:
  This lab was another one of my favorites because we basically coded a sandwich with codes which was very interesting and also got people's attention in the lab but also this   was very challenging to me and my partner.
